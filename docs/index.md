## **Profile**

An experienced Engineering Manager with a strong technical foundation, specialising in platform engineering and developer experience. I lead teams building shared internal platforms and foundations that improve delivery, reliability, and developer effectiveness at scale.

My background includes significant tenure in technical product leadership, giving me a well-developed product mindset that complements my engineering role. I’m comfortable operating at the intersection of people leadership, technical direction, and delivery, helping teams stay focused on outcomes and improving flow through pragmatic ways of working.

I take an analytical, data-led approach to decision-making and technical prioritisation, balancing short-term delivery with long-term platform health. I bring strong technical grounding and I’m comfortable reviewing system designs, challenging assumptions, and balancing trade-offs with senior engineers. I place a strong emphasis on coaching, mentorship, and creating an inclusive, high-trust environment where engineers can do their best work and grow their careers.

## **Relocation & Finland Context**

Planning permanent relocation to Finland. Married to a Finnish national, with close family ties in Finland and regular extended stays over many years.

I speak basic Finnish, with prior formal study and ongoing daily exposure. We raise our son bilingually, with Finnish spoken at home, and I am comfortable living and working in a bilingual environment. I am continuing to improve my Finnish through regular use.
