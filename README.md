👋 Hi. I’m Alex Omand, a Software Engineering Manager specialising in platform engineering and developer experience.

I currently work at Marks & Spencer as Engineering Manager for the Web Platform, where I lead teams building shared foundations that improve delivery, reliability, and developer effectiveness at scale. My background includes significant experience in technical product leadership, which gives me a strong product mindset alongside my engineering and people leadership focus.

## 🚀 What I Do
- Lead engineering teams building and operating Internal Developer Platforms and shared web foundations.
- Focus on developer experience and enablement, reducing friction through tooling, standards, and platform capabilities.
- Balance people leadership, technical direction, and delivery, supporting engineers to grow while maintaining a healthy, sustainable platform.
- Contribute to organisation-wide engineering practices through technical leadership, mentoring, and collaboration.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository contains my public CV, published via GitHub Pages. A small CI workflow also generates a matching PDF for convenience.

### Live CV
- The most up-to-date version of my CV lives in `docs/index.md`.
- It is published at alex.omand.uk using GitHub Pages.

### PDF version
- The PDF is generated by a separate GitHub Actions workflow on pushes to `main`.
- The workflow renders the published CV to PDF and commits the result back into `docs/` so it is served by Pages.
- Any PDF-specific formatting lives in print-scoped CSS so the web version stays clean.

### Updating the CV
- Edit `docs/index.md` to update the live CV.
- Changes pushed to `main` automatically rebuild and redeploy the site and PDF.

This repo is intentionally simple and lightweight, treating the CV as a versioned, deployable artefact rather than a static document.
